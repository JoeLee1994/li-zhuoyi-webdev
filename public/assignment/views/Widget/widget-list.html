        <p>We hear stories about actors being cast as superheroes who have never picked up a comic book all the time, but Hugh Jackman took this a step further when he showed up for his Wolverine audition back in the late ‘90s for the first <em>X-Men</em> movie. He didn’t even know wolverines existed—and he found out in the most delightfully awkward way.</p>
        <p>“I didn’t even know there was a wolverine,” said Jackman at a press event earlier this week, according to <a href="http://pagesix.com/2017/05/19/hugh-jackman-had-no-idea-wolverines-are-real-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page Six</a>. “I literally, embarrassingly did about two weeks of research on wolves. I was rehearsing for three weeks and I was shooting, so I was kind of on my own. I remember going past an IMAX in Toronto, and there was an IMAX documentary about wolves, and so I thought, ‘I’ll go and see that.’”</p>
        <p>So Jackman came to the<em> X-Men</em> set and started being the best wolf-esque superhero he could be, until director Bryan Singer stopped him.</p>
        <p>“He said, ‘Are you sort of walking funny, what’s going on?’” Jackman remembered. “And I said, ‘I’ve been doing this thing with wolves,’ and he goes, ‘You know you’re not a wolf, right?’”</p>
        <p>When Singer told Jackman Wolverine was, you know, based on a wolverine:</p>
        <p>“I said, ‘Well, there’s no such thing as a wolverine,’” Jackman said. “[Singer said] ‘Go to the zoo, dude.’ I literally didn’t know it existed.”</p>
        <p>This makes me very happy, but it’s honestly not <em>that</em> embarrassing. If someone doesn’t know wolverines exist, I could easily see them thinking Wolverine is a superhero name modified on the character’s core concept, a la Tigra or Magneto. Plus, Jackman grew up in Australia, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are zero wolverines</a> and very little reason for anyone to bring them up.</p>
        <p>Besides, I think we all have things we <em>think</em> we know are true, but are not in any way, shape, or form. For instance, I somehow graduated college without knowing that the word “crayon” wasn’t pronounced like “crown.” I said it that way for 24 years with total certainty I was correct.</p>
        <p>Still, Wolverine didn’t know wolverines were real until after he was Wolverine. Fun!</p>
